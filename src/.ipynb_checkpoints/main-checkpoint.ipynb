    "The purpose of this exploratory data analysis project is to assess the possibility and accuracy to predict car accident severity in Seattle, USA exploiting collision track records from past accidents that were recorded by the Seattle Police Department (SPD) and provided as open data by Traffic Records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to predict car accident severity from extrenal factors like weather, location, road conditions as well as speeding, influence of alcohol/drugs etc. will allow the government to put appropriate meassures in place to reduce accident severity, but above all, allow the police and first response teams to channel their ressources and increase efficiency\n",

    "This decrease of deaths in car accidents is related to measures, enforced by the law (e.g. [seat belt law, 1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_laws_in_the_United_States)), advanced safety features (mandatory [air bags](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/federal-legislation-makes-airbags-mandatory) (1998)), but also improved road safety.\n",
